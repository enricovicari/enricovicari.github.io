    <div class="problem problem-8">
      <p>When I started designing Toribash I probably barely knew about “UX”. I was gamer though and also an observer. I liked to play games on my computer and whenever there was something off I used to note it down “for later”. Because of it’s simplicity and extremely old design Toribash was one of those games where I couldn’t just note it down and forget about it, I had to do something.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Problem solving</strong></p>
      <p>When you find yourself pressing the wrong button, or going around and around looking for something that you can’t find, that is when you know something is wrong. Once that is clear you need to list everything and make sure you’re not overwhelmed with the result. Toribash was a short project but it was fun. I identified couple of things that I really wanted to fix and I let my design spin around those few features. Easy search, sorting, friends. Once you know what you want to fix you might want to have some references. And so here comes Google. “multiplayer UI” or “games UI” to understand what makes a game, a good game. Seeing something visual makes you think about the reason behind that button being there, that feature being named that way instead of something else. All these questions help you going to the next step which is sketching out a rough idea.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Sketching</strong></p>
      <p>My brainstorming is usually very messy, which is fine because this is what brainstorming looks like, otherwise it wouldn’t be a storm, it would be a calm rain maybe even just a chill wind. However, because I’m a tidy person the brainstorming phase is the most exciting part for me. Every time I get to “a point” I need to tidy everything up and draw tables, lists and everything that helps with sorting ideas. It’s a nice system which I’m now using with more confidence. Lot of post-it work too if multiple people are involved.

For the first draft I had my mind clear on what I wanted and luckily for me there was an entire forum waiting to judge my horrible mess. I posted my first design on the official Toribash forum and I received a number of feedbacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Guerrilla Usability Testing (but better)</strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong>With the first post on the forum begun my iteration phase. Each comment was crucial because it was coming directly from the people who were potentially going to use that interface. It was also very important to group together similar feedbacks and give them the right weight. I started changing the colour palette to be closer to the official one, someone even suggested me with the official hex code and font. Really appreciated!

I also moved the settings and tried to design something easy instead of something just pretty. There were about 8 versions, each one with big and small changes. The latest one received really good feedbacks and everyone loved it. Fun fact: someone even asked “Where can I download this skin?”&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>The implementation</strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong>After couple of weeks all the issues were fixed and the post was still going strong on the forum, receiving positive messages every day. It might have been so unusual, to see people focusing so much on just one thread, that the developers themselves sent me an email not long after. They asked me if I was able to share my design with them and I would lie if said I wasn’t the happiest kid on hearth that day. My design? implemented on my favourite game? must be a dream.

I ran to Sketch and started slicing everything up, ready for export. I then polished the TGAs and sent the assets to the developers. Couple days later they sent me credentials to access the beta channel, a few MB of updates and my shiny interface was there, fully functioning. It felt great.

It wasn’t a massive work but the fact that it went from something that I just wanted to show around to the actual game was huge to me. Me and the developers then fixed couple of things in following days and few weeks later the update was pushed into the main channel, available to anyone to install.</p>

    <p class="problem problem-10">Visual design</p>
    <p class="problem problem-11">It was quite easy to work with Toribash. It was the first time trying to follow “guidelines”. At first I struggled, trying to push the boundaries and designing something which didn’t really meet Toribash identity. I then focused on a more clean approach, improving what the existing brand design had to offer instead of trying to build something new. This exercise was extremely useful years later in an actual workplace. Because of the nature of the game I also emphasised on the most important CTA (“Enter”) and on the sorting/filtering options. It was important not to move the attention away from the list of rooms which remains the most important part of the screen.</p>

    <p class="problem problem-12">Conclusions</p>
    <p class="problem problem-13">Born as an experiment to try out some features in Sketch and see how other people would react to my design, Toribash has been a really great project. It gave me a 1:1 dialog with the final users making it possible to improve the design quickly and precisely. Being something already in production it also gave me the opportunity to work with guidelines and to explore design patterns in pc games. The hand-off was a total surprise and it’s been a really good exercise to understand how to move in an agile/scrum environment before even knowing about these concepts. When the new design went live I felt honoured but I also felt the pressure of having 10k+ people looking at and using my design. I also made a redesign for the chat interface which is available on my Behance profile.</p>
